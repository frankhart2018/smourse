# Smourse

Interpreter for the smourse language. Smourse is an esoteric language which requires users to code in morse code rather than using unicode characters. Smourse is not aimed to be used for software development, but is a tool for programmers to think fast, because while programming using smourse one not only has to keep in mind the logic but also the morse code for each character which sharpens once thinking capabilities.

## Steps to run

1) Using Visual Studio

- Just hit build and run, that's it :)

2) GCC

```bash
user@programmer~:$ cd smourse/
user@programmer~:$ gcc -std=c++11 -I include/ src/*.cpp
```
